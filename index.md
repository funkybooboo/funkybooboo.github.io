# Hi, I'm Nate Stott.
## Software Engineer | Computer Scientist

Welcome to my portfolio. This is where I document my work in software engineering, share updates on my projects, and occasionally write about technology.

Check out my [Projects](/projects/) to see what I've been building, or visit the [About Me](/about/) page for my full background and resume.


EDIT FOR DEMO
