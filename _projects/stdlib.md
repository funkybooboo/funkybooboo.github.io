**Repository:** [github.com/funkybooboo/stdlib](https://github.com/funkybooboo/stdlib)

Standard library implementation with core data structures, algorithms, and math utilities. Built entirely from first principles without any third-party dependencies or language standard library usage.

## Key Features

*   **From First Principles:** Every data structure and algorithm implemented from scratch
*   **Zero Dependencies:** No third-party crates or standard library usage
*   **Educational Focus:** Clear, well-documented implementations for learning
*   **Comprehensive Coverage:** Core data structures, algorithms, and utilities

## Implemented Components

*   **Data Structures:** Vectors, linked lists, hash maps, trees, graphs
*   **Algorithms:** Sorting, searching, graph traversal, dynamic programming
*   **Math Utilities:** Number theory, linear algebra, statistics
*   **Memory Management:** Custom allocators and memory pools

## Technology Stack

*   **Language:** Rust
*   **Build System:** Cargo
*   **Testing:** Comprehensive unit tests for all components
*   **Documentation:** Inline documentation explaining implementation choices

## Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates deep understanding of:
*   Low-level memory management and pointer manipulation
*   Algorithm complexity analysis and optimization
*   Systems programming concepts
*   Software design patterns and abstractions
