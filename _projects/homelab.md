**Repository:** [github.com/funkybooboo/homelab](https://github.com/funkybooboo/homelab)

A comprehensive homelab infrastructure managed entirely as code, demonstrating DevOps best practices and infrastructure automation at scale.

## Key Features

*   **Infrastructure-as-Code:** Entire environment reproducible and version-controlled
*   **Containerized Services:** Docker and Kubernetes orchestration for self-hosted applications
*   **Workflow Automation:** n8n-based automation eliminating repetitive tasks
*   **Network Security:** VLANs, firewall rules, and Tailscale VPN for secure remote access
*   **Self-Hosted Applications:** Media servers, monitoring tools, development environments

## Technology Stack

*   **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes
*   **Automation:** n8n workflows, Bash scripting
*   **Networking:** Tailscale VPN, VLAN configuration, firewall management
*   **Storage:** Network-attached storage (NAS) setup
*   **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi automation systems, Tor relay node

## Learning Outcomes

This project serves as a practical learning ground for infrastructure concepts, allowing hands-on experience with:
*   Container orchestration and service mesh architectures
*   Network segmentation and security hardening
*   Automated deployment pipelines
*   Infrastructure monitoring and observability
*   Disaster recovery and backup strategies
