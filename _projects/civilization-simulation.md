description: A Multi-Agent System simulation modeling emergent societal behaviors.

**Repository:** [github.com/funkybooboo/civilization_simulation](https://github.com/funkybooboo/civilization_simulation)

This project is a sophisticated Multi-Agent System (MAS) simulation that models the growth and interaction of a civilization. It serves as a testbed for various algorithmic strategies in resource management and decision making.

## Algorithms Implemented

*   Epsilon Greedy: Used for balancing exploration vs. exploitation in agent decision making.
*   Optimal Stopping: Applied to resource gathering and mate selection processes.
*   Priority Scheduling: Manages the execution order of agent actions to simulate concurrent behavior realistically.

## Research Context

This simulation was developed to study emergent behavior in complex systems, demonstrating how simple individual rules can lead to complex societal structures.
