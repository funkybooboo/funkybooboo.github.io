# InsightHub

**Repository:** [github.com/funkybooboo/insighthub](https://github.com/funkybooboo/insighthub)

InsightHub is a flexible platform designed for building, configuring, and comparing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It allows researchers and developers to test different RAG configurations against various datasets.

## Core Capabilities

*   **Configurable Pipelines**: Swap out different retrievers, vector databases, and LLMs to test performance.
*   **Dataset Agnostic**: Import any dataset to test how different RAG strategies perform on specific domains.
*   **Comparison Tools**: Side-by-side comparison of generated answers to evaluate accuracy and relevance.

## Tech Stack

*   **Language**: Python
*   **Vector Stores**: Pinecone, Qdrant
*   **Frameworks**: LangChain, OpenAI API
