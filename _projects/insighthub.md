**Repository:** [github.com/funkybooboo/insighthub](https://github.com/funkybooboo/insighthub)

A flexible platform for building, configuring, and comparing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems across any dataset. Enables rapid experimentation with different RAG architectures and configurations.

## Key Features

*   **Modular RAG Pipeline:** Configurable components for embedding, retrieval, and generation
*   **Multi-Model Support:** Integration with multiple embedding models and LLMs
*   **Vector Database Flexibility:** Support for Pinecone, Qdrant, and other vector stores
*   **Comparative Analysis:** Side-by-side comparison of different RAG configurations
*   **Dataset-Agnostic:** Works with any dataset format for maximum flexibility

## Technology Stack

*   **Language:** Python
*   **Vector Databases:** Pinecone, Qdrant
*   **LLM Integration:** OpenAI API, Hugging Face models, LangChain
*   **Embeddings:** Sentence transformers, OpenAI embeddings
*   **Framework:** Custom RAG pipeline architecture

## Use Cases

*   Research and experimentation with RAG architectures
*   Benchmarking different retrieval and generation strategies
*   Building domain-specific question-answering systems
*   Prototyping AI-powered knowledge bases
