**Repository:** [github.com/funkybooboo/rylee](https://github.com/funkybooboo/rylee)

Rylee is a custom-built chess engine designed not just to play optimal moves, but to mimic human behavior. The goal is to create a more realistic and interesting opponent for learning players, rather than a perfect, unbeatable machine.

## Goals

*   Human-like Play: Simulate "natural" mistakes and strategic patterns common to human players.
*   Adaptive Difficulty: Adjust gameplay style based on the opponent's skill level.

## Implementation Details

Rylee utilizes advanced AI techniques to evaluate board states. Unlike traditional engines that rely solely on Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning for optimal play, Rylee incorporates probabilistic models to choose moves that a human of a certain rating might select.
